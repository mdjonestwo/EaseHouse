            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to beta version 1.0 of EaseHouse. EaseHouse is an inventory web application built by me, Michael Jones, to simplify documenting inventory data. </p>
    
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>I initially created EaseHouse for a food distribution company that worked for to solve a communication problem. When the pandemic hit, our company decided it would be best to have the admin team work from home while the warehouse team stayed in the facility to pack orders to be delivered. This created a problem with communication between the admin team and the warehouse team around how much space was available in the coolers that we stored our food in. The quantities of products in our excel sheets did not accurately represent how much space was available in the coolers. Since the admin team couldnâ€™t physically see how much space we had in the coolers a lot of products, time and money was wasted during that time. </p>
    
            <p>I began developing EaseHouse during that time while I was in coding bootcamp. Unfortunately by the time I finished a solid MVP for that use case, the company began to lift its restrictions and allowed the admin team back into the warehouse. This was a detriment to the initial excitement for the application. The application did not provide value to the company with the functionality present at that time and in turn was never utilized.  </p>
    
            <p>However all of that hard work was not for nothing. I came to realize that this was only the beginning of a potentially highly functional application for many import and export businesses who wanted to simplify their inventory recording systems. I decided to continue working on this application as a long term side project that could be used by businesses who see its value. </p>
    
            <h2>Current Status </h2>
            <p>Majority of the features presented on this application are not developed and are only used to provide insight to the vision for the app. </p>
            <p>If you would like to see what functionality is currently available please follow a long with the How To Video located below. </p>

            <p>If you have any comments or questions feel free to contact me <a href="" class="contact">here</a></p>
            <p>Thanks, 
                Michael Jones</p>
